Project 2 - Using data from Ames Iowa

# Ames Housing Project 

## Objective:
How can understanding previous homes sales be used to understand what unique home features affect home price?  WHat features will generate a higher price when selling a home?  Answering these questions was the key to this problem in Ames, Iowa. Developing a proof of concept of a model that would predict the price of a house on key features will prove to be very useful for real estate firms.

Data sourced for this project was sourced here:

## Process:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: EDA process to evaluate, clean, and analyze key variables and its effect with the sale price.
- Create relevant interaction features to prove or disprove assumptions.
- Develop Model: Develop a multiple linear regression models with polynomials and/or regularizations, and evaluate the results to predict the sales price based model output.
- Prevent Findings.

### Visual Evaluation:
Create the following visual graphics to visually look for patterns and relationship between features and Sale Price:
- Correlation Heat Map
- Scatterplots
- Barcharts
- Histograms
- Boxplots

### Models:
Primary models used: Linear Regression, along with Ridge and Lasso Regularization



### Key Features that lead to a higher sale price: 
- Overall quality/condition of the property
- Total Square Footage
- Home Age
- Number of cars garage
- Living room area
- Year Built / Year remodeled or addition to house
- Number of rooms above ground
- Number of bathrooms
